# Inventory App (WIP)
This app is meant to test me on my ability to create a basic Express app with CRUD and MVC properties.

To run this app, go here: (link to be added).

I based this inventory around the monkeys and categories of monkeys from BTD6. You can create, read, update, and delete the monkeys and categories. Usage is intuitive.

P.S. This app is a part of The Odin Project's course.
